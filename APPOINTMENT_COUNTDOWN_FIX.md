# Appointment Countdown Timer Fix

## Issue
The countdown timer on the appointment details page was causing an "Attempt to read property "timestamp" on string" error because `$appointment->started_at` was being treated as a string rather than a Carbon object.

## Root Cause
1. The `$appointment->started_at` field is a string, not a Carbon object
2. The code was trying to access `->timestamp` directly on the string
3. The countdown timer was not properly using the appointment's actual duration

## Solution
1. Fixed the timestamp access by using `\Carbon\Carbon::parse($appointment->started_at)->timestamp` to properly convert the string to a Carbon object and get its timestamp
2. Implemented dynamic countdown based on the appointment's actual duration:
   - 30 minutes for 30-minute appointments
   - 40 minutes for 40-minute appointments
   - 60 minutes for 60-minute appointments
3. Added localStorage persistence with appointment-specific keys to maintain timer state across page reloads
4. Improved error handling and edge case management

## Key Improvements
- Properly parses the started_at timestamp from string to Carbon object
- Uses the actual appointment duration for countdown calculation
- Maintains timer state across page reloads with localStorage
- Handles expired sessions by resetting to the appropriate duration
- Provides better error handling and logging

## Verification
The appointment details page should now:
1. Load without the timestamp error
2. Display a countdown timer based on the appointment's actual duration
3. Persist the timer state across page reloads
4. Properly end the session when the time expires
5. Clear the timer when the session is manually ended or cancelled
