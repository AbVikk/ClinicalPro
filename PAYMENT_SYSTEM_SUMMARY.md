# Payment System with Paystack Integration - Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of the payment system with Paystack integration for the ClinicalPro healthcare management system. The implementation includes:

1. Installation of the Paystack PHP library
2. Creation of a dedicated PaymentController
3. Development of comprehensive payment views
4. Configuration of Paystack API keys
5. Implementation of payment routes
6. Enhancement of the Payment model

## Components Implemented

### 1. Paystack Library Installation
- Installed `yabacon/paystack-php` via Composer
- Added Paystack configuration to `.env` and `.env.example` files

### 2. PaymentController
Created `app/Http/Controllers/Admin/PaymentController.php` with the following methods:
- `index()` - Display list of payments with statistics
- `create()` - Show form for creating new payments
- `store()` - Save new payments to database
- `show()` - Display payment details
- `edit()` - Show form for editing payments
- `update()` - Update existing payments
- `destroy()` - Delete payments
- `initializePaystack()` - Initialize Paystack payment transactions
- `handlePaystackCallback()` - Handle Paystack payment callbacks
- `invoice()` - Generate payment invoices

### 3. Payment Views
Created comprehensive Blade templates in `resources/views/admin/payments/`:

#### a. Payment Index (`index.blade.php`)
- Displays payment statistics (Total Payments, Completed, Pending, Total Amount)
- Shows paginated list of payments with status indicators
- Includes action buttons for viewing, editing, and deleting payments

#### b. Create Payment (`create.blade.php`)
- Form for adding new payments with validation
- Fields for patient selection, amount, payment method, status, reference, and transaction date
- Special Paystack payment form that appears when Paystack is selected

#### c. Edit Payment (`edit.blade.php`)
- Form for editing existing payments
- Pre-populated fields with current payment data

#### d. Payment Details (`show.blade.php`)
- Detailed view of payment information
- Associated appointment and consultation details
- Print invoice functionality

#### e. Payment Invoice (`invoice.blade.php`)
- Professional invoice template with print functionality
- Patient and payment details
- CSS print styles for clean invoice printing

### 4. Routes
Added the following routes in `routes/web.php`:

#### Payment Management Routes
- `GET /admin/payments` - List all payments
- `GET /admin/payments/create` - Create new payment form
- `POST /admin/payments` - Store new payment
- `GET /admin/payments/{payment}` - Show payment details
- `GET /admin/payments/{payment}/edit` - Edit payment form
- `PUT /admin/payments/{payment}` - Update payment
- `DELETE /admin/payments/{payment}` - Delete payment
- `GET /admin/payments/{payment}/invoice` - View payment invoice

#### Paystack Integration Routes
- `POST /admin/payments/paystack/initialize` - Initialize Paystack payment
- `GET /admin/payments/paystack/callback` - Handle Paystack callback

#### Admin Wallet Top-Up Routes
- `GET /admin/wallet/topup` - Show wallet top-up form
- `POST /admin/wallet/topup/initialize` - Initialize wallet top-up payment
- `GET /admin/wallet/topup/verify` - Verify wallet top-up payment

#### Webhook Route (Public)
- `POST /paystack/webhook` - Handle Paystack webhook events

### 5. Payment Model Enhancements
Updated `app/Models/Payment.php` with:
- Additional fillable fields for new database columns
- Constants for payment methods and statuses
- Relationships with consultation, clinic, and order models

### 6. Database Schema
The payment system works with the existing database schema that includes:
- `user_id` - Foreign key to users table
- `appointment_id` - Foreign key to appointments table
- `consultation_id` - Foreign key to consultations table
- `clinic_id` - Foreign key to clinics table
- `order_id` - Foreign key to pharmacy_orders table
- `amount` - Payment amount
- `method` - Payment method (including 'paystack')
- `status` - Payment status
- `reference` - Payment reference
- `transaction_date` - Transaction timestamp

## Paystack Integration Features

### 1. Initialization
- Converts amounts to kobo (smallest currency unit for NGN)
- Uses Paystack secret key from environment variables
- Redirects to Paystack payment page

### 2. Callback Handling
- Verifies transaction with Paystack API
- Updates payment status in database
- Provides user feedback on payment success/failure

### 3. Security
- Uses environment variables for API keys
- Validates all incoming requests
- Implements proper error handling

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
Added to `.env` and `.env.example`:
```
PAYSTACK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_2e540f18ac5d0954a64ae13954c88312cd7f52f1
PAYSTACK_PUBLIC_KEY=pk_test_92d01ed53e749bf73bc4841ecd60359e1fc9d901
```

### Testing Keys
For development, use Paystack test keys:
- Secret Key: `sk_test_xxxx`
- Public Key: `pk_test_xxxx`

## Usage Instructions

### 1. Setup
1. Obtain Paystack API keys from Paystack dashboard
2. Update `.env` with your actual Paystack keys
3. Run `php artisan config:cache` to refresh configuration

### 2. Processing Payments
1. Navigate to Payments section in admin panel
2. Click "Add Payment"
3. Select patient and enter amount
4. Choose "Paystack" as payment method
5. Fill in patient email
6. Click "Initialize Payment"
7. Complete payment on Paystack page
8. System automatically updates payment status

### 3. Viewing Payments
- All payments are listed with status indicators
- Click on any payment to view details
- Generate invoices for payments

## Webhook Implementation

The system includes a dedicated webhook controller for handling asynchronous Paystack events:

- **Controller**: `App\Http\Controllers\PaystackWebhookController`
- **Route**: `POST /paystack/webhook` (public route)
- **Security**: Signature verification using HMAC-SHA512
- **Events Supported**: `charge.success`, `transfer.success`, `invoice.success`

This implementation is essential for handling Dedicated Virtual Account (DVA) deposits and other asynchronous payment events.

## Security Considerations

1. API keys stored in environment variables
2. Input validation on all forms
3. CSRF protection on all forms
4. Proper authentication and authorization
5. Secure handling of payment callbacks
6. Webhook signature verification for external requests

## Future Enhancements

1. Refund processing functionality
2. Payment reports and analytics
3. Multiple currency support
4. Recurring payments for subscriptions

## Testing

The system has been tested with:
- Route availability verification
- Database schema compatibility
- Form validation
- Paystack API integration (using test keys)
- Invoice generation

## Dependencies

- Laravel Framework
- Paystack PHP Library (yabacon/paystack-php)
- Bootstrap CSS Framework (existing in project)
- jQuery (existing in project)
