# Pharmacy System Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of the pharmacy system for the Telehealth platform. The system implements a centralized inventory model with batch tracking for secure, traceable stock management.

- `unit_price` - Standardized selling price
- `is_controlled` - Hides from general PWA search if true

### Inventory & Logistics Tables

#### Drug Batches Table (New)

#### Payments Table (Modified)
- `order_id` - Nullable foreign key to pharmacy_orders

#### Pharmacy Orders Table (New)

## Laravel Controller Structure & Role-Based Logic

### Primary Pharmacist Role (Logistics & Master Inventory) üì¶
**Controller**: `PrimaryPharmacistController.php`
- **Receive Bulk Stock**: Creates new DrugBatch records with unique batch_uuid and updates clinic_inventories for the Central Warehouse
- **Approve Transfer**: Decrements stock_level in the Central Warehouse and sets stock_transfers.status to 'shipped'
- **Manage Catalog**: Creates/Updates records in the drugs table, setting the crucial is_controlled flag

### Senior Pharmacist Role (Clinic Inventory Management) üìã
**Controller**: `SeniorPharmacistController.php`
- **Request Stock**: Creates records in stock_transfers with source_id=Warehouse ID and destination_id=Clinic ID, setting status='requested'
- **Receive Stock**: Increments stock_level in clinic_inventories and sets stock_transfers.status to 'received'
- **Low Stock Alert**: Displays clinic_inventories records where stock_level‚â§reorder_point

### Clinic Pharmacist Role (Sales & Fulfillment) üõçÔ∏è
**Controller**: `ClinicPharmacistController.php`
- **In-Clinic Sale**: Deducts quantity from clinic_inventories, creates pharmacy_orders and payments records, and checks for controlled drug prescriptions

### Patient PWA Controller (Drug Restriction Gate) üßë‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è
**Controller**: `PwaPharmacyController.php`
- **PWA Pharmacy View**: Shows active prescriptions and OTC drugs (excluding controlled substances)
- **PWA Search**: Restricts search results to non-controlled drugs only

### Doctor's Role (Prescription Authorization) ‚úçÔ∏è
**Controller**: `Doctor\PrescriptionController.php`
- **Issue Prescription**: Creates prescriptions with status='active' and associated prescription_items
- **Fulfillment Check**: Shows which items have fulfillment_status='purchased'

## Views Created

1. **Pharmacy Dashboard** - General overview for all pharmacist roles
2. **Stock Management** - For senior pharmacists to request and receive stock
3. **Sales** - For clinic pharmacists to process sales
4. **PWA Pharmacy** - For patients to view prescriptions and OTC drugs
5. **Doctor Prescribe** - For doctors to create new prescriptions

## Routes Added

- Admin pharmacy routes for all three pharmacist roles
- Doctor prescription routes
- Patient PWA pharmacy routes
- General pharmacy dashboard route

## Seeders Created

1. **CentralWarehouseSeeder** - Creates the central warehouse record
2. **DrugsSeeder** - Seeds sample drugs (both controlled and non-controlled)
3. **TestPharmacistSeeder** - Creates a test pharmacist user for development

## Implementation Notes

1. All migrations have been created and executed
2. Models have been created with proper relationships
3. Controllers implement the specified business logic
4. Views have been created for all user roles
5. Routes have been added to web.php
6. Middleware has been updated to handle pharmacist roles
7. Seeders have been created for initial data

The pharmacy system is now fully implemented and ready for testing and further development.
