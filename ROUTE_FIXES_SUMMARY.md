# Route Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

1. **Notification Routes Issue**: Removed all notification-related functionality from the sidemenu as requested
2. **Patient Route Issue**: Fixed incorrect route references from `doctor.patient.show` to `doctor.patients.appointment-history`

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Notification Functionality
- Removed notification dropdown with data attributes from sidemenu
- Removed all notification-related JavaScript code
- Completely removed notification system as requested

### 2. Fixed Patient Route References
Replaced all instances of:
```php
route('doctor.patient.show', $id)
```

With:
```php
route('doctor.patients.appointment-history', $id)
```

This affected the following files:
- `resources/views/doctor/dashboard.blade.php` (12 instances)
- `resources/views/doctor/sidemenu.blade.php` (removed completely)

## Routes Available
The only patient-related route available in the doctor section is:
- `GET doctor/patients/{patient}/appointment-history` (named: `doctor.patients.appointment-history`)

## Verification
All caches have been cleared:
- Route cache
- View cache
- Config cache

The doctor dashboard should now load without route errors.
